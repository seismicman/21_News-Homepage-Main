## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I developed this chalenge in React using components and CSS for the styles. It was so useful to understand the HTML elements as section, articles, nav/ul/li and button.

Also, it was very useful to understand Flexbox to organize the different components of the User Interface and the use of media queries to switch between desktop and mobile versions.

It was so useful to learn about the library of Jonathan Suh, https://jonsuh.com/hamburgers/ highly recomended to generate hamburguers menu.

Regarding the functionality of this challenge in react, I used four components: "Master"as main component and "Head", "Principal" and "Footer" as secundary components to have a code more organized. An usestate "isactive" to control the hamburguer menú. With the value of these parameters I used conditional rendering to show the elements and show and hide the hamburguer menú.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, Bootstrap, Tailwind among others.
